Monica Hall
Thanks for coming in, guys. We have a lot to do, so let's get started.

Richard Hendricks
Sounds great. Me? Okay. Uh, well, we're just really excited to get going, Mr. Gregory. Yes.

Peter Gregory
Who's we?

Richard Hendricks
Myself. Him. The guys back at the house.

Peter Gregory
Guys? What guys? Who is this?

Erlich Bachman
Ehrlich Bachman. I'm an entrepreneur, much like yourself. Richard actually developed Pied Piper while residing in my incubator. So as per our agreement, I own 10% of the company.

Peter Gregory
I'm paying you $200,000 for 5%, yet you're giving this man twice that in exchange for a futon and some sandwiches?

Erlich Bachman
Actually, sir, my tenants provide their own food.

Peter Gregory
What other percentages have you apportioned? Can I see your cap table, investment deck, business plan, or any other relevant paperwork you may have prepared?

Richard Hendricks
I just was under the impression that we would just be coming by and saying hi, you know, to pick up the check. And I just didn't know that any of that stuff was due yet.

Peter Gregory
Due? This is not college, Richard. I'm not going to be giving you a course syllabus. You turned down $10 million to keep Pied Piper. What did you give up that money for? What is this company? What did I buy?

Richard Hendricks
You bought the algorithm, which...

Peter Gregory
No! The algorithm is the product of the company. I know that. What I'm asking about is the company itself. Who is it? What do they do? Are they essential? Or do you just throw a percentage at them like you did with this? This all must be worked out now.

Richard Hendricks
When you said you'd guide us through some of the stuff, if I thought that this was the stuff you'd be guiding us through.

Peter Gregory
I cannot guide you until you give me something to guide. This is going very poorly.

Monica Hall
I know.

Peter Gregory
He doesn't seem to know what he's doing. Did you just take a sip from an empty cup?

Richard Hendricks
Yes.

Peter Gregory
Why did you do that?

Richard Hendricks
Just something to do.

Peter Gregory
Come back in 48 hours with an airtight business plan, a clear go-to-market strategy, and a three-year summary P&L, or there will be no check. That's it.
