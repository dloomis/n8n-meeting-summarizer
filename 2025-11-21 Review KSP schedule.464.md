### TL;DR 📝
Platform team faces critical VMware Broadcom license renewal costs (~$2M) due to Block 30 migration delays caused by parallel IL-6 deployment work. Azure Stack Hub environment rebuild adds 3-week delay after Dell/Microsoft misconfiguration required complete teardown.

### Key Discussion Points 🔑
- Azure Stack Hub IL-6 environment requires complete rebuild after Dell added 8 nodes simultaneously (against Microsoft guidance), causing storage replication to crawl at 0.5% per week
- Block 30 migration timeline will slip past July-August VMware license expiration due to divided efforts between Block 30 and IL-6 work
- Lieutenant Colonel Johnson needs cost justification for license renewal and projected cloud costs for IL-6 Atlas deployment by week after Thanksgiving
- Steve demanding integrated Microsoft Project schedule across L3Harris (Mike Mariani) and Platform (Dan Loomis) teams, but no unified owner exists
- Atlas must migrate to IL-6 cloud by July 2027 per NPS hardware renewal terms
- September 2026 Atlas migration timeline deemed unrealistic; July 2027 more reasonable
