# A business plan defines company identity and structure before product development can proceed

An investor's capital buys ownership in a *company*, not merely a product or technology. This distinction reveals why business planning must precede or accompany technical development—the algorithm, however brilliant, exists within a structure of ownership, roles, and strategy that determines whether value can actually be captured.

Peter Gregory's interrogation of Richard Hendricks exposes a common founder blindspot: conflating product excellence with company viability. Richard assumed the compression algorithm *was* the company, but Gregory immediately redirected to structural questions: Who comprises the team? What do they do? Are they essential? How is ownership distributed? These questions define the vehicle through which the product reaches market and generates returns.

The cap table dysfunction illustrates why this matters practically. Erlich Bachman holds 10% for providing housing—twice the percentage Gregory receives for $200,000 in capital. This isn't just unfair; it signals that equity has been allocated without strategic reasoning. Every percentage point given away reduces future flexibility for hiring key talent, raising additional capital, or incentivizing essential contributors. Gregory's pointed question—"What other percentages have you apportioned?"—suggests he suspects the problem runs deeper than one bad deal.

The 48-hour ultimatum establishes three components of minimum viable business planning: an **airtight business plan** (company identity and structure), a **clear go-to-market strategy** (how the product reaches customers), and a **three-year summary P&L** (financial projections demonstrating viability). These aren't bureaucratic exercises—they force founders to articulate assumptions that would otherwise remain unexamined until they cause problems.

Gregory's refusal to "guide" without something to guide reveals an important dynamic in investor-founder relationships. Mentorship requires raw material. A founder who arrives expecting direction without having done foundational thinking cannot receive useful guidance—there's nothing to react to, refine, or redirect.

## Key structural elements demanded

- **Cap table**: Complete ownership breakdown showing all equity holders and their percentages
- **Investment deck**: Presentation materials explaining the opportunity to potential investors
- **Business plan**: Comprehensive document defining company identity, team, and operations
- **Go-to-market strategy**: Plan for how the product will reach and acquire customers
- **Three-year P&L**: Projected profit and loss statement demonstrating financial trajectory

## Open questions

- At what stage should formal business planning begin relative to product development?
- How should early equity grants (like incubator arrangements) be structured to preserve future flexibility?
- What signals indicate a founder is ready for investor guidance versus needing more independent development?
- How do the three demanded documents (business plan, GTM strategy, P&L) interact and inform each other?
