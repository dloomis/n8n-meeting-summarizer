### TL;DR 📝
Initial investor meeting with Mr. Gregory derailed when Richard arrived unprepared without basic business documentation, revealing he had already allocated 10% equity to Ehrlich Bachman for incubator services. Gregory demanded a complete business plan, go-to-market strategy, and financial projections within 48 hours or the investment deal is off.

### Key Discussion Points 🔑
- Richard turned down $10 million to keep Pied Piper but lacks fundamental business structure and documentation
- Ehrlich Bachman owns 10% of company equity for providing incubator space (no food included)
- Mr. Gregory's $200,000 investment for 5% equity is contingent on receiving proper business documentation
- Cap table, investment deck, and business plan are completely missing
- Richard misunderstood meeting expectations, thinking it was just a casual check pickup
